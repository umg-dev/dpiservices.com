										<h3>What is a captive?</h3>
										<p>It is a property casualty insurance company and it is formed to cover only the risks of the parent company. The Oxford Captive Structure only covers enterprise risks that are low frequency but high severity. Examples could be: product contamination, business interruption, product recall, mechanical breakdown, transit risks, crop insurance, etc.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon fa-laptop">
										<h3>How does a Captive work?</h3>
										<p>The captive is a “C” corporation formed under a department of insurance, typically in Delaware, Tennessee, North Carolina, etc.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon fa-code">
										<h3>What are the primary benefits of a Captive?</h3>
										<p>The objective is to manage risks and change an expense into a profit center by combining a captive with your commercial insurance.</p>

										<p>Premiums paid to the captives are tax deductible, if reasonable, by the parent company. Premiums received by the captive are not taxable as well as underwriting profits until distributed. A captive must invest like an insurance company.</p>

										<p>Ancillary Benefits:</p>

											1. Captive could be a subsidiary of the primary business.<br>
											2. Builds up the balance sheet.<br>
											3. Ownership of the captive off balance sheet / works with an asset protection structure.<br>
											4. Ownership could provide succession planning strategies for the next generation, or provide benefits to key employees.
									  </p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon fa-headphones">
										<h3>What is the first step?</h3>
										
											1. Oxford is engaged through a feasibility process that includes a review of all your existing commercial coverages.<br>
											2. A recommendation of which Oxford coverages would be the most beneficial.<br>
											3. Actuarial pricing of each coverage is recommended.<br>
											4. Domicile recommendation.<br>
									</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
										<h3>What is the cost?</h3>
										<p>The cost of a feasibility study is $23,000 which is applied to total first year implementation fee of approximately $65,000. Ongoing Captive Management fee is currently $53,000.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
										<h3>Cost benefit analysis</h3>
											1. Ongoing Captive management.<br>
											2. Oxford program is compliant with all tax rules.<br>
											3. All legal work will be completed for insurance structure.<br>
											4. All coverages have been reviewed by the Department of Insurance.<br>
											5. Actuarial work will be completed with pricing of the coverages.<br>
											6. Oxford fronting carrier has already been set up and capitalized.<br>
											7. Ongoing compliance is provided by the Oxford team.<br>
